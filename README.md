# Surfs Up, Dude

### The purpose of this anaylsis is to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Analysis was completed on the summer month of June and the winter month of December to compare the temperature differences.

## Temperature Analysis

#### June

#### December

- The mean temperature differs by less than 4 degrees in the months of June and December, which supports the idea that a surf and ice cream shop can perform well year-round. The winter months will not hurt from a temperature perspective.
- The max temperatures for June and December are 85 and 83, respectively. This shows that it gets to be almost as warm in the winter as it does in the summer, which is very important for a shop that will be open year-round. The warmer the weather, the more likely patrons will want to surf and eat ice cream.
- The minumum temperature is the one variable in the data that could prove to be problemsome for year-round growth. In June it is 64, while in December it is 56, showing that there is a much higher fluctuation in the temperature in the winter than in the summer. The colder days will be colder in the winter, which will keep people from frequenting the shop. However, because the 25%, 50% and 75% interquartile ranges are fairly close to even, it really should not cause a big time reduction in sales.
